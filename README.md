# Libertydev

Project abandoned - This repository was created to make Vite drop in builder for @nwrl/web which is built on Webpack

Along with vite and my vast interest in SolidJs I wanted to add this too. At the time of making this first beta version. @nxext just released the solidjs and vite builder.

So as of now I've joined the effort of Nxext located here https://github.com/nxext/nx-extensions.  And already merged the two repository together.
